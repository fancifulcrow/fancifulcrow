# Hello There!

I’m interested in solving real-world problems through **data-driven systems**, **research** and **practical design**. My work focuses on using machine learning and scientific computing to build tools, systems, and insights that are both functional and meaningful.

### Tools & Technologies

**Languages**  
Python • JavaScript

**Machine Learning & Data Science**  
NumPy • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Plotly • Scikit-Learn • TensorFlow • PyTorch

**Web Development**  
Node.js • Vue • TailwindCSS, SQL, Flask

**Other Tools**  
Git • VS Code

I’m always exploring new libraries, frameworks, and ways to improve my workflow and expand my technical toolkit.

### Interests

* **Applied Machine Learning**  
  Designing ML systems that tackle real-world challenges, with a focus on practical deployment and reliability.

* **Model Interpretability**  
  Building models that not only perform well but can be trusted, understood, and explained—especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or finance.

* **Scientific & Research Computing**  
  Leveraging computation to explore and answer complex questions, particularly in interdisciplinary research settings.
